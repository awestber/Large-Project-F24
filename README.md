Predicting Lung Cancer Risk

This project was my goal to analyze a lung cancer dataset to identify potential similarities between the symptoms and the development of lung cancer. While using logistic regression modeling to predict the probability of lung cancer. 

Two VMs had to be set up and configured in order to implement my code that I created for this project. I then had to load the data from my dataset that I chose to use from Kaggle (Dataset). This dataset contains many different columns, including gender, smoking, alcohol, chronic disease, SOB, chest pain, lung cancer and more. One of the VMs I will use to train the data is called the developmental VM and the second VM I used for the testing code.

Errors and Issues
	During this project I ran into countless issues. The proposal I wrote and what I wanted to do worked well and I didn't receive anything that needed to be changed so I thought everything was going well. When I started to do all the VM configuration and setting up the Hadoop and Spark that's when I ran into many issues. The steps to configure the VMs were very hard to understand so i had to use the help from looking up multiple videos for help and still running into issues. My VMs wouldnt configure correctly so i kept getting eros so the TA had to help with that and then once they were configured the VMs won't stay connected to be able to connect to the internet so i was not able to install the necessary packages to run my code. I ended up writing my code separately so that I could at least understand what was going on and what I wanted to do with the project given. Once the VMs get working and figured out correctly I hope to be able to implement my code into those VMs and get some results.
